# JCountry

This project tries to replicate the same functionality as [pycountry](https://github.com/flyingcircusio/pycountry) by wrapping iso files and provide a programatic interface.

This will help having a quick source for translations of country names, and the extra information provided by:
- ISO 3166-1 (Countries)
- ISO 639-2 (Languages)

For the status of the translations, please check the [iso codes](https://github.com/sailfishos-mirror/iso-codes) repository (which is the original source of the iso files and translations).
